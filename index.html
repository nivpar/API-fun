<body onload="getWeather()">
	<div id="data">Loading...</div>
	<div> 1. The API I selected is the Open Weather Map API. It has weather data for places around the world. </div>
	<div> 2. <a href = "https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map/endpoints">https://rapidapi.com/community/api/open-weather-map/endpoints</a> is the website I found it from</div>
	<div> 3. The options I used for my API request was just the current weather option. </div>
	<div> 4. One application for this data is to use it to make a weather website where the temperature of a place is shown along with all other smaller stats like humidity, min/max temp, etc. Another application for this API could be to do data analysis on temperature over a time period in a place and see how it has changed compared to different years.
